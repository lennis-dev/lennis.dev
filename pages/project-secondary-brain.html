    I have written a "Second Brain" for myself, which is a collection of notes, ideas, thoughts, and much more. I use it
    to organize my thoughts and ideas and to keep track of them. The project is written in PHP, JavaScript, HTML and
    CSS. The project is currently not open source, but I am working on it.
