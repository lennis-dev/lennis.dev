        The synxit project is one of my biggest projects, it is a project that I have been working on for a long time
        and am still working on it with a few Friends. The project is a very secure and highly encrypted online storage
        for files,calendars, contacts and much more. The project uses AES 256 encryption and Elliptic Curve
        Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange to encrypt the data and is a zero-knowledge system, meaning that the data is
        encrypted on the client side and only the client has the key to decrypt the data. The best thing about the
        project is that it is completely Open Source and Contributions are welcome. You can find the project on <a
            href="https://github.com/synxit" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

        The project is written in PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We trying to keep the project as simple as possible so
        we trying to avoid using frameworks and libraries as much as possible.
