    I have written a small tool that allows you to disguise your email address on your site and hide it from
    crawlers, the user has no major restriction except that Javascript must be enabled in the browser. and the best
    thing is it's no big effort for you, you just have to paste your email in a text field and your browser creates
    a code that you then paste on your website at the place where the email address should be.
